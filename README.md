Hi! My name is Kelsey Morrison. I just got married this past December to my wonderful husband, Nathaniel. 
We love to cook and bake lots of good food (I am a total foodie). I am a figure skater, a gamer, a cat
mom, and I play D&D with my husband. My dream vacation is to go to Japan and eat everything and see 
everything.
Looking forward to learning more in the technology world!
